### An intuitive guide on utilizing Ballerina’s SQL-like query syntax in real life

[Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang) cloud-native programming language developed to make consuming, combining, and creating network services easier. Ballerina `Swan Lake`, the next major version of Ballerina language was released this year with major improvements to all aspects including *an improved type system, enhanced SQL-like language-integrated queries, enhanced/intuitive service declarations,* and many more.

The main motive behind ballerina is **to enable developers to focus on business logic while spending less time on integrating cloud-native technologies**. The intuitive way of defining and running services on the cloud using Ballerina’s inbuilt network primitives plays a key role in this revolution. Flexible type system, data-oriented language-integrated queries, enhanced and intuitive concurrency handling along with inbuilt observability and tracing support, make Ballerina one of the go-to languages for the cloud era.

In this project, we are going to use language-integrated queries to mine some interesting facts out of the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo.
